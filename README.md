## Purpose of this documentation

This guide assists you in rapidly developing your VoIP application with Zoiper SDK 2.0. This manual contains an overview of the entities in the SDK with a lot of practical examples of implementation, usage and configuration.

**To obtain the SDK package, please contact us on zoiper.com**

## Licensing

To enjoy the powerful benefits of Zoiper SDK 2.0, you need a license. Depending on your needs, you can buy 2 different types of licenses:

- Installation license per end-user
- Unlimited installations;

Please [<span style="color:orange">contact Zoiper</span>](mailto:sales@zoiper.com) for more details and test licenses or to receive licenses for testing purposes.

## Threading model

Zoiper SDK 2.0 is thread-safe. Shared objects can be called simultaneously from multiple threads. All callbacks from the SDK modules to the application code are performed in the context of the application thread which invokes the respective functions and methods.

In order to receive callbacks, the SDK needs to receive processing time from your application core. You can achieve this by invoking the respective functions.

On Android, iOS, and macOS, the main UI thread usually handles the assignment of processing time to the SDK.

Regarding sockets and transports, the SDK manages and utilizes the threads internally. For the interaction with sockets and transports, the SDK also internally manages and utilizes its own separate thread. As a result, the application code can use the processing time without blocking the SDK sockets.

![](./docs/choose_modules.jpg)

## Setting up the Demo project
### Default configuration
Transport type: TCP
Enabled codecs: 
- aLaw
- uLaw
- GSM
- speex
- iLBC30
- G729
- VP8 

STUN: Disabled
- Default STUN settings:
- Server: stun.zoiper.com
- Port: 3478
- Refresh period: 30

### Activation

Before you can test the demo app, you need to activate the SDK. You will receive a username and password from Zoiper.com. 

##### Manual 
Enter the activation credentials before you build the application in assets/credentials.json. Please note: you might first need to rename the file to credentials.json. 

When the activation is fine, the status will change to “Success”.  You can now start testing the demo app. 

When the registration fails, you will receive a “Failed” status, followed by an error code. Please, check the status in the console log. 

##### Hardcoded
If you prefer hardcoded credentials, you can use  the following call:

```
private class ActivatorThread extends Thread{
    ActivatorThread() {
        super("ActivatorThread");
    }
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Load the credentials.
        Credentials credentials = Credentials.load(getApplicationContext());
        // It is wise to offload that to a background thread because it takes some time
        zdkContext.activation().startSDK(
                getCertCacheFile().getAbsolutePath(),
                credentials.username,
                credentials.password
        );
    }
}
```

Do not take your credentials from the GUI, but pass them. Please mind that the activation is put in a different thread for reasons of optimization.

### Account registration

You need a SIP account to register to the server and make calls. Configure it in 2 steps:
1. Enter the details (username, password and hostname at least)
1. Click on the „Register“ button 

The status screen will show the registration status. When the registration is successful, you should be able to make calls. If not, then the status screen will show an error code.

### Changing the project configuration
To change the SIP configuration, you will need to adjust the calls in:
```
private func createDefaultSIPConfiguration() -> ZDKSIPConfig
```
You can adjust the configuration by using the following method calls.
#### Transport type
```
sipConfig.transport(TransportType.TCP);
Possible values: .NA, .TCP, .UDP, .TLS
```
#### STUN
```
if(Configuration.STUN){
    sipConfig.stun(createStunConfig(ap));
}
...
private StunConfig createStunConfig(AccountProvider ap){
    final StunConfig stunConfig = ap.createStunConfiguration();
    stunConfig.stunEnabled(true);
    stunConfig.stunServer("stun.zoiper.com");
    stunConfig.stunPort(3478);
    stunConfig.stunRefresh(30000);
    return stunConfig;
}
```
#### Rport
```
sipConfig.rPort(RPortType.Signaling);
```
Possible values: 
- No
- Signaling
- SingnalingAndMedia

#### DTMF
```
public static final DTMFTypeSIP DTMF_TYPE = DTMFTypeSIP.SIP_info_numeric;
```
Possible values: 
- .NA
- .Inband
- .RFC_2833
- .SIP_info_numeric
- .Disabled

#### Changing the used codecs
```
@NonNull
private List<AudioVideoCodecs> getAudioCodecs() {
    List<AudioVideoCodecs> codecs = new ArrayList<>();
    codecs.add(AudioVideoCodecs.OPUS_WIDE);
    codecs.add(AudioVideoCodecs.PCMU);
    codecs.add(AudioVideoCodecs.vp8); // This is for the videocall
    return codecs;
}
```
Possible values:
- NA
- G729
- GSM
- iLBC_20

## Create your Android VoIP App

Set up your environment in the same way as you did for the demo application. 
Keep in mind that your application must run on a real device. It cannot be used with simulators. To use Zoiper SDK 2.0, you need to import it as a new module into your project. You can do so as follows:

1. In Android Studio from `Flle->New->New module...`;
2. Choose `Import .JAR/.AAR package`;
3. Find the Zoiper SDK 2.0 file and choose it;
4. After Zoiper SDK 2.0 is added to the project open `Flle->Project structure` and select the `Dependencies` tab
5. Add a new dependency of the application to Zoiper SDK 2.0;
6. Make sure you initialize Zoiper SDK 2.0 context into your application. This way, you can use all of its functions.

Here you can find a sample of initializing the context:

###### Initialize Zoiper SDK 2.0 Context in the application
```
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        initializeZoiperContext();
        mainHandler = new Handler(getMainLooper());
    }
```
###### Zoiper SDK 2.0 initialization function example
```
    public void initializeZoiperContext(){
        zdkContext = makeZoiperContext();
        zdkContext.setStatusListener(this);

        // Before we can use the instance, we need to activate it.
        new ActivatorThread().start();
    }

    private Context makeZoiperContext(){
        // We create the Context instance
        // NOTE: Keep this object single-instance
        try{
            Context zdkContext = new Context(getApplicationContext());

            File logFile = new File(getFilesDir(), "logs.txt");

            zdkContext.logger().logOpen(
                    logFile.getAbsolutePath(),
                    null,
                    LoggingLevel.Debug,
                    0
            );

            // Make sure you have both
            // ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
            // and
            // INTERNET
            // permissions!!!!!!!!!!!
            zdkContext.configuration().sipUdpPort(5060);
            //zdkContext.configuration().iaxPort();
            //zdkContext.configuration().rtpPort();

            zdkContext.configuration().enableSIPReliableProvisioning(false);
            zdkContext.encryptionConfiguration().tlsConfig().secureSuite(TLSSecureSuiteType.SSLv2_v3);
            zdkContext.encryptionConfiguration().globalZrtpCache(getZrtpCacheFile().getAbsolutePath());

            return zdkContext;
        } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

```
Keep in mind that inside the initialization the SIP and RTP ports will be also initialized.
Right after the Zoiper SDK 2.0 is initialized, it is best to activate its license by using the activation username and password, provided to you by [Zoiper.com](https://www.zoiper.com/). The activation can be done by invoking the activateZDK method like so:
```
zdkContext.activation().startSDK(
	getCertCacheFile().getAbsolutePath(),
	credentials.username,
    credentials.password
    );
```
